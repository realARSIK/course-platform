# Course-platform

A web application for publishing, managing, and selling online programming courses in JavaScript. Created as part of a coursework project.


## About

This is a coursework project developed by Arseniy Kachalin with the goal of creating a comprehensive platform for online learning. The platform focuses on JavaScript programming courses and provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both instructors and students.

The project includes a client-side built with **Next.js** and a server-side using **Strapi** for content management and handling API requests. The application allows instructors to create and manage courses, while students can browse, purchase, and enroll in courses.

This project is designed to serve as a solid foundation for an online learning platform and can be expanded with additional features in the future.
